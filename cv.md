## About me
Now I am studying to be a designer at a technical university, I do web design in my free time, that's why I wanted to explore the frontend field in order to immerse myself more professionally in this type of activity and start building my career. Previously, I was preparing for professional training in information security, but so far it has not worked out.  I know python and javascript at a basic level, html and css. Besides Belarusian and Russian, I know English at the B1-B2 level. It is capable of quick learning and capturing any information, as well as multitasking.
